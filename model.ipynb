              "  \"as jessica and i were walking home from dinner on march 11, at the corner of garden and walker streets, these three threads converged. screw the vcs who were taking so long to make up their minds. we ' d start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we ' d been talking about. i ' d fund it, and jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we ' d get robert and trevor as partners too. [ 13 ] once again, ignorance worked in our favor. we had no idea how to be angel investors, and in boston in 2005 there were no ron conways to learn from. so we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.\",\n",

              "  'one day in 2010, when he was visiting california for interviews, robert morris did something astonishing : he offered me unsolicited advice. i can only remember him doing that once before. one day at viaweb, when i was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. that was what it took for rtm to offer unsolicited advice. so i remember his exact words very clearly. \" you know, \" he said, \" you should make sure y combinator isn \\' t the last cool thing you do. \"',\n",

              "  \"i learned some useful things at interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. i learned that it ' s better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people ( though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it ), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it ' s depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there ' s not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.\",\n",

              "  \"so i looked around to see what i could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was lisp. i knew from experience that lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with ai, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. so i decided to focus on lisp. in fact, i decided to write a book about lisp hacking. it ' s scary to think how little i knew about lisp hacking when i started writing that book. but there ' s nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. the book, on lisp, wasn ' t published till 1993, but i wrote much of it in grad school. computer science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. the theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. i wanted to build things. i had plenty of respect for theory — indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves — but building things seemed so much more exciting.\",\n",
